# Melanoma Detection

This project presents a web app that uses a model for melanoma detection using PyTorch and Flask. One can run the web app by navigating towards the `src` folder and running `python main.py` (assuming all required packages have been installed).

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be found [here](https://github.com/nickvdw/melanoma-detection/blob/master/notebooks/eda.ipynb).
